Hello fellow coders! 🔥

- I'm Mahdieh, a programming ninja 🥷 and a true believer in the power of technology to change the world. As a software developer, I spend my days diving deep into code, crafting elegant solutions to complex problems, and pushing the limits of what's possible with technology.

  But that's just the beginning. 💻 
- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently a second year phd student at Macquarire university and reserach assistant at UNSW. 
- 🧬 I work with two amazing teams at Macquarire university and UNSW on the project of "Data to Therapy (D2T): a bridge made of artificial intelligence from genomic data to targeted therapy". My current focus is on developing AI algorithms to analyze genomics and medical data and improve patient outcomes. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems in healthcare and beyond.

So if you're as passionate about programming and tech as I am, let's connect and see what we can create together! Check out my online portfolio, and let's start making magic happen. 🔮
